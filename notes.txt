To enable SGX by software after SoftwareAttestation in BIOS:

1. Clone Repository: git clone https://github.com/intel/linux-sgx.git
2. Paste File into repository: cp -r "File_Location"/enable_sgx.cpp linux-sgx/sdk/libcapable/linux
3. Goto directory: cd linux-sgx/sdk/libcapable/linux
3. Make: make
4. Compile: gcc enable_sgx.cpp -o enable_sgx -L. -lsgx_capable
5. Check if SGX has been enabled: sudo LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. ./enable_sgx

To test if sgx is enabled, go to linux-sgx/sdk/libcapable/linux and use the fllg command:

If is_sgx_capable is eqaul to 1, then SGX has been enabled.

what exists
1- central homomorphic training (openmined tutorial)
2- fl gan training (yaqubdesign)
3- fl homomorphic training (nvidia clara)

what i want
1- fl gan homomorphic training

what to do - run nvidia clara fl homomorphic training


setup more clients on project-cpt
setup 4 or more clients
setup same system as HE on 2nd run

setup project-cpt-gan
create GAN on the
create GAN HE instead of the normal one

automate key distribution for password unzipping?

where is the client data stored???
where is the model???

apply AutoML feature to get better results in the future by automating parameter tuning


make client timeout more than 10 min




be conscious when learning the language
consume a wide variety (genre) of media
audio books, tv, movies
repeat words you hear out loud
